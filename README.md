## Description 

Script for exporting installed packages to list (Markdown) in Arch linux for Flatpack, AUR, Official. Example [here](https://cloud.disroot.org/s/4K63rWKJZ9YDxcP) (from [my Telegram channel PingvinusFun](https://ttttt.me/pingvinusfun) (RU), where I talk about my adventures and discoveries in OpenSource and Linux, which I became actively interested in 2023, [post with example](https://ttttt.me/pingvinusfun/34)). To get packages, I use `flatpak`, `pamac` and `grep` to exclude unnecessary strings. All tests were performed on Manjaro Linux

## Usage

Do the following in terminal or just launch with a mouse click (or how many of them you need to produce ðŸ˜‰)

 ```bash 
 pythonÂ ./script.py
 ```
 The packages of each type of package will be written to the appropriate text file: `Flatpak.txt`, `AUR.txt`, `Official.txt`
